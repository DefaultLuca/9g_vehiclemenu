## 9g_vehiclemenu - VEHICLE MENU for ESX Framework



## Introduction

Simple vehicle menu for tweaking with doors and windows.
Also toggle indicator, headlight, and extra.
(engine toggle and locksystem events from other resources)


## Requirements

- ESX Framework
- esx_menu_default
- optional esx_locksystem45
- optional 9g_extratools


## Support

-   https://github.com/DefaultLuca
-   Feel free to edit the code, just refer the author.


## Installation

- Download the resource and add this in your server.cfg:
    start 9g_vehiclemenu


## How it works

- Allow the player to toggle doors, windows and etc.
- To open menu, default button: F5.
- The player must be in a vehicle and/or in the driver seat.
- If you are in the driver seat you can do use all commands.
- If you are not in the driver seat you are restricted to toggle stuff(door and window) of the relative position.

- For the engine toggle and locksystem you need to edit the code with your own event (line #38 and #41).
- I'm using a edited version of esx_locksystem45, the event ls:togglelock is not in the original.
- For the engine toggle I made my own resource.
